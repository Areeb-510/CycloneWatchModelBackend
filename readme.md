# Cyclone Watch

The Cyclone watch is an innovative and potentially life-saving Android application aimed to provide timely and accurate warning signals to users in tropical regions when there is a possibility of a cyclone. The app utilizes data from INSAT-3D  Images, which are captured at 15-minute intervals, to analyze and predict cyclone formation, intensification, and landfall.
